                <p class="help-text">People who cannot afford good housing tend to live in flood-prone areas, where education levels are low. In turn, income tends to be lower for people with limited education. Previous studies have shown that poor people are the most vulnerable to disasters, and suffer greater consequences from them than rich people . The poor have less capacity to anticipate, resist, and recover from natural hazards [10]. Our study honed in on this finding by focusing on a specific city.</p>
